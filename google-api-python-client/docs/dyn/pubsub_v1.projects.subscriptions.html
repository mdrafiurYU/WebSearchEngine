<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Acknowledges the messages associated with the ack tokens in the AcknowledgeRequest. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a subscription to a given topic for a given subscriber. If the subscription already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS. If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns NOT_FOUND. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes an existing subscription. All pending messages in the subscription are immediately dropped. Calls to Pull after deletion will return NOT_FOUND. After a subscription is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old subscription, or its topic unless the same topic is specified.</p>

<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges the messages associated with the ack tokens in the AcknowledgeRequest. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.

Args:
  subscription: string, The subscription whose message is being acknowledged. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
    "ackIds": [ # The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned by the Pub/Sub system in the Pull response. Must not be empty.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a subscription to a given topic for a given subscriber. If the subscription already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS. If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns NOT_FOUND. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the subscription. It must have the format `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A subscription resource.
  "topic": "A String", # The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. The value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.
  "ackDeadlineSeconds": 42, # This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered again during that time (on a best-effort basis). For pull delivery this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call ModifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ack_id. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message. If this parameter is not set, the default value of 10 seconds is used.
  "pushConfig": { # Configuration for a push delivery endpoint. # If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
    "attributes": { # Endpoint configuration attributes. Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the push message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the envelope (i.e. its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API. If not present during the CreateSubscription call, it will default to the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a ModifyPushConfig call, its value will not be changed. GetSubscription calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The possible values for this attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

A `Binding` binds a set of members to a role, where the members include user accounts, user groups, user domains, and service accounts. A 'role' is a named set of permissions, defined by IAM. The definition of a role is outside the policy. A permission check first determines the roles that include the specified permission, and then determines if the principal specified is a member of a binding to at least one of these roles. The membership check is recursive when a group is bound to a role. Policy examples: ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:frontend@example.iam.gserviceaccounts.com"] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] } ```

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which policy is being specified. Resource is usually specified as a path, such as, projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk}. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
    "policy": { # # Overview The `Policy` defines an access control policy language. It is used to define policies that are attached to resources like files, folders, VMs, etc. # Policy structure A `Policy` consists of a list of bindings. A `Binding` binds a set of members to a role, where the members include user accounts, user groups, user domains, and service accounts. A 'role' is a named set of permissions, defined by IAM. The definition of a role is outside the policy. A permission check first determines the roles that include the specified permission, and then determines if the principal specified is a member of a binding to at least one of these roles. The membership check is recursive when a group is bound to a role. Policy examples: ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:frontend@example.iam.gserviceaccounts.com"] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] } ``` # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the 'resource'. The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is in general a valid policy but certain services (like Projects) might reject them.
