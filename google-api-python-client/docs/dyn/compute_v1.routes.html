<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of route resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Name of the project scoping this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, Maximum count of results to be returned.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Use this parameter if you want to list the next page of results. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: FIELD_NAME COMPARISON_STRING LITERAL_STRING.

The FIELD_NAME is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The COMPARISON_STRING must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The LITERAL_STRING is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field (string, number, boolean).
